1.Write a query to find the countries with the highest temperatures in the dataset?
-> SELECT Country
   FROM country_pollution
   ORDER BY Temperature DESC
   LIMIT 1;
2.Write a query to identify the countries with the lowest CO2 emissions in the dataset.
-> SELECT Country
   FROM country_pollution
   ORDER BY CO2 Emissions ASC
   LIMIT 1;
3.Write a query to find all temperature records above a specific value, for example, 20 degrees Celsius.
-> SELECT *
   FROM country_pollution
   WHERE Temperature > 20;
4.Write a query to list all countries with CO2 emissions data available for the year 2020.
-> SELECT DISTINCT Country
   FROM country_pollution
   WHERE Date = 2020;
5.Write a query to count the total number of temperature records in the dataset.
-> SELECT COUNT(*)
   FROM country_pollution;
6.Write a query to identify any countries with missing temperature data for a specific year, for example, 2015.
-> SELECT Country
   FROM country_pollution
   WHERE Date = 2015
   AND Temperature IS NULL;
7.Write a query to find the average temperature for each year in the dataset.
-> SELECT Date,
   AVG(Temperature) AS average_temperature
   FROM country_pollution
   GROUP BY Date
   ORDER BY Date;
8.Write a query to calculate the total CO2 emissions for all countries in the dataset.
-> SELECT SUM(CO2_Emissions) AS total_emissions
   FROM country_pollution;
9.Write a query to sort the temperature data in descending order b the temperature values.
-> SELECT *
   FROM country_pollution
   ORDER BY Temperature DESC;
